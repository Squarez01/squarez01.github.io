# My Documentation Site

Hello! My name is Michael, I am just getting started in this crazy world of homelab fun! sometimes it is amazing and other times I have no idea what is going on!

I plan on using this site to document some of the different projects that I do so that maybe one day I will feel confident enough to share them. At the very least I will have notes on the steps to get different things up and running, just in case anything fails.

Thanks for visiting!
