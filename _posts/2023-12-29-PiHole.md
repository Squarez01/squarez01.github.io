# Pihole setup

I have Pihole set up fairly successfully on my network at home. I have two instances of it running. One is running on a VM inside of proxmox. The other is running on a Raspberry Pi zero W. this helps with redundancy incase one goes down. 

Pihole is also set up as a recursive DNS server. I used a video from Craft computing for this. [Recursive DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnFtWsZ8IP0&t=858s)

They are using [Gravity sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFVYe3riDRA&t=421s) so I only have to make changes on one instance of pihole and they will be synced to the other automatically.

# Set up  of clients
This was for my Wife and certain other devices that had issues with pihoile being set up on. 
## Create a group

 Then you **DO NOT** assign a block list to that group.

Now you need to define the device you want in **Client Group Managment** then you assign that device to group that bypasses the Pihole ad blocking.

# How to update Pihole
This is very simple simply ssh into each instance of Pihole and run the following command.

```shell
pihole -up
```
Thankfully is a very easy process!
