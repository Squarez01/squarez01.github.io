# Jekyll Docs site

This website has absolutly been a labor of love. This took me much **longer** than it really should have. the viseo tutorial made everything look very easy and simple... it was far form that... 

I intend to use this to try and document everything that i have done with my server, all of the VMs, containers, and servers that i have set up. 

This video is what I used to set up this site
