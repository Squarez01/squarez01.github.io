# Getting Started with Homepage
This will walk you throught the steps that I used to create my new Homepage dashboard. I will also save my configuration files here. 

[HomePage](https://gethomepage.dev) is a neat tool to hlep organize all of the services and websites that you may host locally or even remotely.
